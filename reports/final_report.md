# Simulation of Epidemic Spreading in Scale-free Networks
## by Seungin Lyu


### Abstract

How do viruses in scale-free networks spread? What is the probability that a strain of virus survives over a period time? We answer these questions by replicating an experiment by Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [1] which involves running the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on Barabasi and Albert's (BA) power law graphs. We apply their methodology to a Facebook dataset [4] to further explore their model on a real-world network. We show that viruses with any spreading rate reach a steady state of prevalence of *ρ ~ exp(-C/λ)* on scale-free networks. We conclude that scale-free networks are prone to epidemic spreading regardless of the spreading rate because there exists a finite prevalence for all network sizes, but the prevalence is kept low for a wide range of spreading rates because the prevalence decays exponentially as the spreading rate increases.

### Replication of Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani's experiment

Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani originally asked the question "Why do epidemic spreading models with local connectivity contradict with the statistical observations of virus epidemics that viruses are able to pervade and spread much slow than exponentially, and saturate to a low level of persistence?" [1]. While looking for an explanation and designing a model, they hypothesize that running SIS model simulation on Barabasi and Albert's graph will illustrate the exponential tail of virus prevalence. They claim that previous spreading models with local connectivity like ER graph and WS graph don't illustrate the scale-free nature of the real world networks such as the Internet. In this paper, we replicate the experiment that they conducted with the BA graph to find how prevalent epidemic spreading is in scale-free graphs.

We use the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model as our primary means of simulation. SIS epidemic model mimics infections such as influenza that do not give immunization upon recovery from infection, so individuals become susceptible again. In SIS model, an infected node recovers with probability (rate) *σ*, and susceptible nodes are infected if at least one neighbor is infected with probability (rate) *µ*. We define the spreading rate *λ = µ/σ*. We are able to fix *σ = 1* without loss of generality [1]. Note that updating the status of all nodes is done in parallel; that is, to update the status for time *t*, only statuses of time *(t-1)* of the nodes are considered.

We define a list of terms in our experiment. The virus prevalence *ρ* is the fraction of infected nodes at any time. In this experiment, we examine the prevalence only when the simulation enters a steady state with an oscillating fraction of infected nodes at a constant level. We evaluate the steady-state prevalence *ρ* by calculating the mean of infected nodes at time step t over multiple trials. Additionally, we calculate surviving probability P<sub>s</sub>(t) as the number of trials with a surviving virus at time step t / total number of trials conducted.

We use a BA graph generated from the NetworkX's `barabasi_albert_graph(N, k)` function. We set the number of edges to attach from a new node to existing nodes *k = 3*, which is equivalent to an average node degree of 6. We use the number of nodes N ranging from 10<sup>3</sup> to 8.5×10<sup>6</sup>.

We show the results of our simulation in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

The line is a fit to the form ρ ∼ exp(−C/λ) [1]; (right) We replicate the original plot with our own simulation. We use the identical semi-log axis as used in the original with the same markers. The prevalence constant C, or the slope of the linear fitting line is -0.38. We take the mean of infected nodes at t = 20.*

We replicate the original plot with our own simulation. Note we run the simulation for 50 time steps and run 100,000 trials in total. While the horizontal steady state for N = 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> matches that of the original plot, we observe quantitative differences for all other network sizes.*


<br>

In Figure 1, we illustrate that viruses with spreading rate ranging from 1/22 to 1/7 reach a steady state of prevalence `ρ ~ exp(-C/λ)` on the BA graph. We confirm that our replicated plot of ρ as a function of 1/λ quantitatively agrees with the original. One interpretation of the plot shown in Figure 1 is that viruses persist at a low prevalence that is always greater than 0(finite prevalence) in a BA graph regardless of its size. Another interpretation is that the virus prevalence decays inversely proportional to the spreading rate. So the faster the spreading rate is, the lower the prevalence is going to be. We do observe a discrepancy in the prevalence for 1/λ = 15 for the value marked with the cirle (N = 6.25 × 10<sup>3</sup>) and the value marked with the sqaure (N = 5 × 10<sup>5</sup>). We believe that the discrepancy is an error due to the small number of trials(20) conducted for each λ value.

In Figure 2, we observe that the behavior of surviving probability starts with a rapid initial drop, a trend which agrees with our interpretation of the prevalence graph. Then the suriving probability saturates to a constant linear slope that varies for different network sizes. The virus prevalence plots in Figure 1 and the surviving probability plots in Figure 2 are compatible because, for a fixed spreading rate (λ = 0.065), the surviving probability must proportionally decrease as the network size increases to yield the same level of virus prevalence for all network sizes. While we confirm a qualitative match between the original figure and our result of the simulation, we observe a quantitative difference. The surviving probability in our plot for N < 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> decays more rapidly, roughly twice as faster than that of the original. We do observe in our simulation that running more trials results in a graph that is more quantitatively similar to the original. So this quantitative difference potentially comes from an insufficient number of trials(100,000) conducted in our simulation. However, we are unable to identify the exact cause of this discrepancy because Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [1] did not explicitly mention the number of trials they used.


### Going Beyond: SIS model simulation on Facebook network

Having replicated Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani's original experiment, we believe that the specific BA graph with k = 3 does not represent all scale-free netoworks. If a similar experiment with a real-world graph shows similar results, then the model becomes more convincing. Therefore, we apply the same implementation of the SIS model simulation to a Facebook network data with 88234 edges and 4039 nodes from SNAP[4]. Assuming that the Facebook graph is similar to the BA graph, we expect the same `ρ ~ exp(-C/λ)` prevalance plot as shown in Figure 1.

We observe that running the same simulation on the Facebook data yields the result shown in Figure 3. We confirm that the result qualitatively matches the prevalence plot shown in Figure 1 but quantitatively differs in regards to the slope of the fitting line and the prevalence level.

We know that a BA graph that resembles the Facebook dataset with 88374 edges and 4039 nodes differs greatly when we take a look at the clustering coefficients. The clustering coefficient is 0.037 for the BA graph and 0.061 for the Facebook graph [5]. Assuming that the one of the primary differences between the BA graph and the Facebook graph is the clustering coefficient, we can infer that the difference in the clustering coefficient contributes to the quantitative discrepancy shown in Figure 3. Even if the assumption is not completely true, we can still assume that the clustering coefficient is one of the major factors that contribute to the higher prevalence level and the relatively low prevalence constant C compared to the BA graph.

With higher prevalence level, viruses can stay more prevalent in the Facebook network with more infected nodes than in the BA graph. With a smaller value of the prevalence constant C, the change in spreading rate has less effect on exponentially decaying prevalence. So viruses can pervade in the Facebook network more dominantly than in the BA graph only if we consider this model valid for the Facebook network.

*Figure 3. We run the SIS model simulation on the Facebook data provided by SNAP. We run 100 trials for each spreading rate until time step 50. The prevalence constant C or the slope of the linear fitting line is (-0.11) which differs from (-0.38) of Figure 1. The prevalence level is also substantially higher by a factor of roughly 100.*


### Conclusion

We conclude that scale-free networks are prone to epidemic spreading regardless of the spreading rate because there always exists a finite prevalence that is greater than zero. However, the epidemic prevalence decays exponentially as the spreading rate increases, so the epidemic prevalence is low for a wide range of spreading rate. In other words, only a small number of nodes are going to be infected at a moment for most spreading rates, but the epidemic will continue to pervade. We also identified a potential positive correlation between the epidemic prevalence and the clustering coefficient of a network by investigating the SIS model on the Facebook network. For future work, we suggest further exploring the topic of network clustering to verify the relationship between the epidemic prevalence and the clustering coefficient of a network.

Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani designed a model for the spreading of infections on scale-free networks. They applied the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemiological model on scale-free graphs (Barabasi and Albert). They believe that models with SIS applied to Euclidean lattices, ER graphs, and WS graphs aren’t completely adequate to represent the real phenomenon because the end behavior after time *t* eventually yields either complete extinction or complete prevalence of a computer virus depending on whether the effective spreading rate is greater or less than the epidemic threshold. They discover the absence of the epidemic threshold in scale-free networks and conclude that “infections can proliferate on these scale-free networks whatever spreading rates they may have.

Wang, Yang, and Chenxi Wang proposed a ‘general’ epidemic threshold condition that applies to arbitrary graphs and proves that the epidemic threshold is closely related to the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix under reasonable approximations. They point out that the model proposed by Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani is only limited to the BA graph and only works heavily under the assumption that gamma = 3 when *P(k) = k^(-gamma)* (*P(k)* is the probability that a node has *k* links). They validate their epidemic spreading model on both homogeneous graphs like ER graph and power-law scale-free graphs like the BA graph. They conclude that their threshold condition holds for arbitrary graphs by validating their model through extensive experiments on real and synthesized graphs.

They present a new analytic model called NLDS(nonlinear dynamic system) that makes no assumptions about the network topology and show that their model performs as well or better than the previous models that are targeted specifically to fit certain special case graphs like ER, WS, and BA graphs. This model is an improved version of <i>Epidemic Spreading in Real Networks: An Eigenvalue Viewpoint</i> (written five years later by almost the same group of the author). They conclude that their threshold condition can be used to design new network topologies that are more resistant to viruses.
