"""
Performs the susceptible-infected-susceptible simulation of spread of
viruses/disease through connected networks

Wrtie Down each individual steps very clearly before any implementation

1. generate a network
2. generate some percentage of initially infected nodes
3. for some # of time steps, run simulation of concurrent infection/recovery
